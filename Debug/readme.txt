MazeWars P2 Milestone 2 Test Application

This application is looking for a dll named 'MazeDllP2M3.dll' in the same folder as the exe, so you'll need to rename your dll to that specific name for it to work. 

Note that it is not a typo when it says M3 at the end of the dll name. This test application was originally made for Milestone 3 of the 2nd part of the assignment. Since I removed milestone 2, the old milestone 3 became the new milestone 2.

Also note that you must put the arial.ttf file in the same folder as the .exe for it to work properly.
